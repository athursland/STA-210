# STA-210 Final Project: Predicting Airbnb prices in Asheville, NC
## Overview
This repo contains my final project for STA 210: Linear Regression, F18. In our project, we used web scraping to pull data on Airbnb prices in Asheville,
NC and built a predictive model to find the expected prices of an Airbnb listing in the city based on factors such as zip code, number of beds/baths, etc.
## Structure
- .Rmd  and .pdf files contain write-ups, code and visualizations for our final report
- .png files of visualizations used in our final report
- .csv files contain the airbnb data we used in our analysis
